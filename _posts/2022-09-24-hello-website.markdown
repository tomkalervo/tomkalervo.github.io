I came across this static webpage generator called [Jekyll][jekyll]. Created with Ruby by the co-founder of GitHub; Tom Preston-Werner. Seemed to fit my needs for a simple website featuring a blog and a portfolio. One great aspect is that it has built in markdown feature:

{% highlight elixir %}
def print_hi(name) do
  IO.puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi("Tom")
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Since this is my first post,

`Hello World!`

Cheers,
Tom Karlsson
