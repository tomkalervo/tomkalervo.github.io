There is a great need today for organizations to transition towards data-driven development. Utilizing data can greatly enhance the workflow and give insights that enable the organization to grow within its field. But the sheer amount of data and the broad variety of data sources makes it quite complex to choose a data model. And the data model is the foundation for implementing a data management system. 
This term I will look into a user case, a company named [Ecogain], and evaluate different data models in relation to their data and their workflow. The purpose is to give some guidance for other organizations in the same situation, to better understand the pros and cons of different data models.

Sidenote: [Ecogain] has a most interesting and highly relevant business model. They are experts on ecology and biodiversity - and they use their knowledge to assist other organizations to implement environmental sustainability in their projects. It is inspiring to see more and more organizations incorporating sustainability into their business.
