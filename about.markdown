# My story
I have always had a passion for computers growing up and I was indulged by the Internet when exposed to it in the 90's. But I never actually saw it as a career choice growing up. So I ended up working with media and journalism for ten years. A most educational experience - but my will to get back into technical science grew too strong. With more motivatation than ever before, I studied hard and got a Degree Certificate; Batchelor of Science in Information- and Communication Technology, at KTH in 2023. Today I work with system development at Svenska Handelsbanken, one of the worlds most trustworthy banks. Each day I continue my pursuit for a deeper knowledge in Computer Science and work with the latest technologies with IT.
 
Some of my other hobbies and interests are nature(wildlife), news and political news. I read a lot of morning papers, magazines and online articles. My media career involved news gathering at Swedish Television and I have even produced two documentaries, both more or less about birds or people passionate about birds. I really enjoy being outdoors in the wild and experiencing nature in all its elements.

Oh, and yes, I am also a pretty social guy ^^ 

Cheers!
