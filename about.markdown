# My story
I have always had a passion for computers growing up and I was indulged by the Internet when exposed to it in the 90's. But I never actually saw it as a career choice growing up. So I ended up working with media and journalism for ten years. A most educational experience - but my will to get back into technical science grew too strong. Now I am more motivated than I have ever been, to study harder than I ever have done before - with the goal to work with my true passions; Computer Science and Information Technology.

Some of my other hobbies and interests are nature(wildlife), news and political news. I read alot of morning papers, magazines and online articles. My media career involved news gathering at Swedish Television and I have even produced two documenteraries, both more or less about birds or people passionate about birds. I really enjoy beeing outdoors in the wild and experience the nature in all its elements.

I live in Stockholm, Sweden, since 6 years back together with my girlfriend. Before that I lived 8 years in the town Kalmar in south of sweden. But I grew up in antoher town, Vanersborg, at the west coast. This means I have family and friends spread around larger parts of the country.
