Bachelor thesis: [Unlocking the Potential of Biodiversity Data: Managing and Sharing Data from Biodiversity Surveys].
 
 Abstract: Biodiversity surveys conducted by consulting firms generate valuable biodiversity data. However, the full potential of this data remains untapped without proper structuring and integration into a collaborative network of shared data. This thesis addresses the lack of studies exploring data management in biodiversity surveys and the specific requirements for data structuring. The objective of this Bachelor?s thesis is to introduce the concepts of data management in biodiversity surveys and collaborative data sharing, which have gained scientific popularity due to advancements in data-driven technologies and growing public interest in environmental sustainability. Using a qualitative and exploratory approach based on the Design Science Research paradigm, this research draws general conclusions on data management practices in biodiversity surveys and identifies the requirements for new data standards. The findings of this thesis serve as a starting point for ongoing efforts toward establishing a standardised structure for biodiversity survey data. Such a structure would enable meaningful insights through data-driven technologies and facilitate integration into a collaborative network of shared data. By addressing the gap in understanding data management and data standards in biodiversity surveys, this research contributes to the effective utilization of biodiversity data, ultimately supporting the achievement of sustainability goals.
