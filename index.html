        <p>My name is Tom and this is my site. Here I post notes about stuff I have learnt or found interesting. 
            Currently I am a student at KTH in Sweden. My goal is to develop IT- and software systems with high demands for correctness and efficency.</p>
        <p>There is always more to learn - I love IT!</p>
