      Hi, I’m Tom! Welcome to my corner of the internet—a space where I share insights, ideas, and the occasional spark of inspiration from the things I’ve learned or found fascinating.
      I’m passionate about programming, algorithms, and all things IT. To me, there’s an undeniable art in well-crafted code—a blend of logic, elegance, and creativity.
