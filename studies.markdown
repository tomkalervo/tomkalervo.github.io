I have a Batchelor of Science Degree at Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan (Royal Institute of Technology) in Stockholm, Sweden. 

### Completed Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
- Discrete Optimization, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/home/info), Intermediate level with 8 weeks of study, 10-15 hours per week. Covered concepts include: Branch and Bound, Constraint Programming, (linear) Relaxation, Local Search, Meta-heuristics such as Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing, Linear Programming - including the simplex algorithm, simplex tableau, and duality, Mixed Integer Programming. Also included introduction to advanced topics (such as large neighbourhood search) as well as presenting a lot of different types of NP-hard optimization problems. Completed in January 2024.
