From time to time I come across usefull terminal-commands. To remember them I save them here. Maybe someone else might find this list usefull as well. They are unix-commands since I mainly do work on macOS.

```zsh
tomkarlsson@Toms-MBP ~ % shasum -a 256 filename
8de4bab1ab5424707f94f3a4f0690061fce9807d57f132245ca06da6fed96a5e  filename
```
Gets the 'Secure Hash Algorithms' Sum. Switch out 256 for different algorithms.
